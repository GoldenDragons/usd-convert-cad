The **Omniverse CAD Converter**, distributed using the `usd-convert-cad`
package and command-line identifier, converts supported CAD files to OpenUSD.

This repository contains the NVIDIA Agent Skill and documentation for the
Omniverse CAD Converter. The converter is distributed separately through the
`usd-convert-cad` Python wheel.

The documentation and agent skill in this repository were tested with
`usd-convert-cad==0.3.0` on Python 3.12. Newer wheel versions may add or change
options; check `usd-convert-cad --help` and the installed package version before
relying on behavior not documented here.

This is a Skillhub-style repository for agent-assisted CAD conversion workflows.
It contains the instructions, documentation, and workflow contract that AI agents
use to install, verify, and run the `usd-convert-cad` wheel from a Python
environment.

The repository does not require agents to install Omniverse Kit, pull an
extension from an extension registry, or run a Kit app. Conversion is performed
through the pip-installable `usd-convert-cad` package, which provides the
`usd-convert-cad` command-line entry point and bundles the OpenUSD (`pxr`) and
CAD conversion runtime needed by the tool.

Key repository areas:

- `skills/omniverse-cad-to-usd` - canonical NVIDIA Agent Skill for CAD-to-USD
  conversion.
- `docs` - CAD-to-OpenUSD concept mapping and related documentation.
- `LIMITATIONS.md` - known package and converter limitations.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - contribution policy and supported-format update
  policy.

## Getting Started

Create an isolated Python 3.12 environment, install the package, and verify the
command is available.

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install usd-convert-cad
usd-convert-cad --help
```

Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install usd-convert-cad
usd-convert-cad --help
```

If the package is hosted on an NVIDIA package index rather than public PyPI, add
the appropriate index URL:

```bash
python -m pip install usd-convert-cad --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

The canonical skill lives at
`skills/omniverse-cad-to-usd/SKILL.md`. The installed wheel also includes the
skill so agents can discover the same workflow guidance from the package.

## Requirements

- Runtime: Python 3.12.
- Package: `usd-convert-cad` installed from a Python package index.
- Network: package-index access during install only.
- OS/Arch: Windows x86_64, Linux x86_64, or Linux aarch64.
- Licensing: proprietary CAD formats can require CAD converter licensing.

Use a dedicated virtual environment. The wheel bundles its own OpenUSD (`pxr`)
runtime, so isolation avoids conflicts with other OpenUSD distributions in the
same interpreter.

The wheel is self-contained at runtime and does not depend on Omniverse Kit,
`usd-core`, or a separately installed `pxr` package.

## Usage

After installing the wheel, convert an input CAD asset from the command line.
`usd-convert-cad` is the installed console script; `python -m usd_convert_cad`
runs the same CLI through the Python module.

```bash
usd-convert-cad -i path/to/input.step -o path/to/output.usdc
```

See [`skills/omniverse-cad-to-usd/SKILL.md`](skills/omniverse-cad-to-usd/SKILL.md)
for the full option table.

The output path determines the USD file format. Supported output extensions are
`.usd`, `.usda`, `.usdc`, and `.usdz`. USDZ export converts to a temporary
`{stem}.usdc` layer in an isolated staging directory, then packages it with
OpenUSD. USDZ requires monolithic conversion (`--composition-style none`, the
default). Packaging writes to a temporary archive and replaces the final
`.usdz` only on success. If `--material-type preview-surface-omnipbr` is set,
USDZ export switches to `preview-surface` because OmniPBR materials are not
packageable.

The command returns exit code `0` on success and prints
`Successfully converted: <output>`. On failure, it returns a non-zero exit code
and prints the converter error message to stderr. Agent workflows should branch
on the exit code and confirm the expected output file exists before continuing.

Common conversion options include `--tess-lod`, `--revit-lod`,
`--accurate-tessellation`, `--convert-curves`, `--convert-metadata`,
`--no-dedup`, `--no-normals`, `--no-materials`, `--material-type`,
`--up-axis`, `--instancing-style`, `--composition-style`, `--filter-style`,
`--load-hidden`, `--progress`, `--convert-physics-data`, `--read-constraints`,
and `--view-layer-name`.

Use `--material-type preview-surface-materialx` to author OpenPBR MaterialX
with a USD Preview Surface fallback.

Common examples:

```bash
# Choose output format by extension: .usd, .usda, .usdc, or .usdz.
usd-convert-cad -i assembly.step -o assembly.usdc
usd-convert-cad -i assembly.step -o assembly.usdz

# Export geometry without materials.
usd-convert-cad -i assembly.step -o assembly.usda --no-materials

# Convert metadata and keep hidden CAD elements as hidden USD prims.
usd-convert-cad -i plant.ifc -o plant.usdc --convert-metadata --filter-style hide

# Convert model-space geometry from supported DWG/DXF files—including 2D linework and 3D curves—to USD BasisCurves.
usd-convert-cad -i drawing.dwg -o drawing.usdc --convert-curves

# Increase tessellation level of detail.
usd-convert-cad -i part.jt -o part.usdc --tess-lod 4

# Export CATIA V5/NX/SolidWorks Fix, CATIA V5 Fix Together, NX Bond,
# or SolidWorks Lock mate constraints as USD Physics fixed joints.
usd-convert-cad -i assembly.sldasm -o assembly.usdc --read-constraints

# Convert a CAD view layer or simplified representation by name.
usd-convert-cad -i assembly.asm -o assembly.usdc --view-layer-name "Manufacturing"
```
